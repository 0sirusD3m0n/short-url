#URL SHORTENER

This project was based heavily off of Uma Abu's project. In fact, for now, it is basically identical. 
You can find him on youtube at: https://www.youtube.com/c/UmaAbu

Please ignore my comments on the commits. I was frustrated and cannot be held accountable for my reactions.

Tech Stack:
This project utlizes React for the web client, and utilizes a Flask Python server on the back end to run the app itself on the server side. It also uses 
gunicorn.

The primary purpose of this app was to give me a brief overview of React/Python as I've never used either. My next goal for this app will be to recreated it 
using ASP.NET on the back end.
